Make 'git help everyday' work  (coverletter)

The "Everyday GIT With 20 Commands Or So" is not accessible via the git help system. fix that.

The git everyday file does not use the appropriate filenaming convention for help files, and is not suitably formatted for display as a man page.

First copy everyday.txt to giteveryday.txt
Second modify giteveryday to fit man page formatting. Include the standard Git footer.
Third add giteveryday to the manpages make list.
Fourth add deprecation note to older everday.txt. Include link to new man page.
Fifth add 'everyday' to the help --guides list.
