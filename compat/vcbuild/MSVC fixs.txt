MSVC (2010) in the IDE git fixes.

1. the i18n 5e9637c6 broke engine.pl (git) code for extracting the git.sln for msvc gui-IDE with an extra '-o' option in the make file.
add 'msgfmt' and its precursor 'mkdir' tests.
(in same vein as 74cf9bdda6)

2. the engine.pl (git) script barfs on properly quoted space in filename options prevalent on windows. Use quotewords rather than split to separate such options.

3. add noob clarification comments to the msvc-build (msysgit) script [to get them past the initial kruger-dunning catch-22 step]

4. point git/compat/vsbuild/README) (git) at the new msysgit/bin/msvc-build script for those with msysgit repo.
While we are at it add extra whitespace for extra clarity of the "either"/"or" sub sections (not sure about the indents in step 4 of the README)

5. clarify (in the git/compat/vsbuild/README) (git)) 2008 .sln vs 2010 .suo file changes, and the Windows association change (the web install of VS2010 doesn't associate sln directly with VS2010, rather to the verselector).

6a. resolve if the 'clean' needs MSVC=1 - what is it cleaning - cleaning out the old gcc build, or a faulty MSVC build?
6b. add extra VS-2010 clean actions to msvc-build (msysgit). (vcprojx, etc.)

7. clean the other make lib products in msvc-build (msysgit).

8. document which bash/bat/cmd/vscmd to start from, and how to tell the difference (in the readme (git)?).

9. http://help.github.com/fork-a-repo/ add text about the normal flow for helping on msysgit/devel and whether to use a personal fork.

10?. Sort out what MSVC=1 is meant to represent. At the moment it (appears to) confounds "Windows" environment (as opposed to MinGW etc, in engine.pl) with using the MS Visual C compiler (as opposed to gcc), with a possible further confusion about presumed libraries etc by the MSVC IDE. 

[We want the output of the msvc-build script (plain vanilla) to start OK and compile, and then 
the New Dumb User can investigate this strange new world without being scared off too soon.]

sort when THIS_IS_MSYSGIT arrived in msysgit, and the makefile (the MinGW make section). Was it before or after the MSVC engine was written - i.e. did its introduction break the gui IDE build, or vice versa.

http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.version-control.git/131374/focus=132142 (but you are avoiding the MinGW configuration as well...)

http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9084365/can-git-be-built-with-vc (my comment on PatThoyts' )

This sort of suggests that the original intent was MSVC meant the compiler/IDE and not a raw  "Windows" environment.

10. (side note) rebase -i manual to also point to cherry pick // or, the noop message to add the information about what the noob error was ..  (confusion between rebase branch onto another branch, and rebase interactively the current branch from commit <n> - i.e. the initial mush I committed)

Note that msvc-build has to be run from within the msysgit.bat window, rather than the bash window because they have different facilities. The bash window wont have the ./bin/msvc-build on it's PATH, so won't find it.!

The msvc-build, on top of 1.9.5 (in my 1.9.4 directory) runs and compiles in VS08 OK (no errors)
