This is test 2 of Sourcetrail path/directory methods for Git
https://github.com/CoatiSoftware/Sourcetrail/issues/804

Options appear to be:

    1. All files (compile_commands.json, Git_ScrTrl.srctrlprj, Git_ScrTrl.srctrldb, Git_ScrTrl.srctrlbm) at top level (works)
    2. .json at top level, other three srctrl* in sub dir. (appears to work)
    3. All files in sub dir. (not working yet, relative [to what] path troubles)

1. Open git.sln (double click) starts VS 2017 community ed. (with srctrl extn)
2. (without rebuild) Srctrl 'create database': Directory= C:\git-sdk-64\usr\src\git\Sourcetrail (i.e. subdir) Cstandard= C99
3a. Finish/Import (?) Attempt `Import` - nothing (scrtrl isn't running yet)

3b. start scrtrl (splash screen + 'connected to vs'); VSscrtl extn dialog has gone; redo the extn/import; second Srctrl 'New Source Group' has opened.

3b1 Headers&directories to index: clicked 'select from Comp db', then ticked '..' (was ./ on opt1) only (left all the 'Windows Kits' unchecked). scroll down, exluded's left blank; Next

Note that at this stage there are no other dialog options


3b2 (flicks to the New Project dialog, but as it is still selecting the source groups (C/C++ from Comp Db) its looks unchanged), so select "General" in top left side, and update the project name to "Git_sourcetrail_opt2". location is "ok C:/git-sdk-64/usr/src/git".

 NOT YET 3b3 "Create" !

scroll down to the now available "Additional Compiler Flags" (specified with "-D "
browse the VS project properties for 'git`. Find the C/C++ tab list, open find ' Preprocessor': See (top of list) "Preprocessor Definitions" wioth a long list of ";" separated values. Copy them. Paste to favouriet editor. repeat for `libgit`.

replace all the " -D" with "\n-D" (i.e. swap the space for newline - extended chars), and insert newlines for the last two options.
add -std=c99 and -no-logo
Paste them in via the pen icon.


3b4 switch back to the other Sourcetrail window (now active, with a fresh blue 'start Indexing' dialog). "All files" (dot in circle) should already be selected.
3b5 Click 'Start', wait ~one minute (00:01:38).

4.0 open the compile_commands.json in your favourite editor, from the "command": line select/copy all the "-D" options and the -std and -nologo options, paste to a new file,
4.1  
4.2 Select all, copy, re-focus on the Sourcetrail Edit Project, and past into the additional compile flags (after selecting the scribble pen icon).

3b3 "Create" !
4.3 Save, re-index, start
still Oooffed.

5.0 Back to remembering what I did the first time.

5.1 browse the VS project properties. Find the C/C++ tab list, open find ' Preprocessor': See (top of list) "Preprocessor Definitions" wioth a long list of ";" separated values. Copy them.
see 4.0-4.1 but change ";" to "-D " etc.
needed to use both Git project and Libgit (slightly different set.) YES!

ideally filter for unique. remember last setting wins if you have duplicate but non identical settings.
