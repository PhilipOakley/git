git-bash(0)
==========

NAME
----
git-bash - A Windows initialiser for the bash window on that OS

SYNOPSIS
--------

git-bash [--cd-to-home] [--xx] []

DESCRIPTION
-----------

The `git-bash.exe` provides a windows run time executable that takes in a
 few parameter and then starts (typically) the mintty terminal window
 with a modified path such that `git` is found on the search path [Windows or *nix?]
 and the MSYS2 interface is used to convert path references from windows
 style (c:\w\x\y) to unix style (/c/w/x/y)

 etc. etc.

 More description and explanation of how it all works and the necessary
 levels of redirection and misdirection so that it all 'just works'
 despite severe incompatibilities in operating philosphy..

There is almost no tutorial or documentation suggesting anyone how to create your own custom git-bash.exe arguments like "--cd-to-home" . Can you kindly provide the steps and guidance to do that ?
