git-redo(1)
=============

NAME
----
git-redo - Redo / Reuse a recorded resolution (rerere) of conflicted merges (synonym)

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'git redo' ['clear'|'forget' <pathspec>|'diff'|'remaining'|'status'|'gc']

DESCRIPTION
-----------

Git redo is a synonym for `git rerere`. It is not the complement of any `undo`.

In a workflow employing relatively long lived topic branches,
the developer sometimes needs to resolve (redo) the same conflicts over
and over again, until the topic branches are done (either merged
to the "release" branch, or sent out and accepted upstream).

See linkgit:git-rerere[1]

[NOTE]
You need to set the configuration variable `rerere.enabled` in order to
enable this command.


COMMANDS
--------

Normally, once enabled, 'git redo'(rerere) is run without arguments
or user-intervention.

If run manually, then run 'git redo' immediately after a conflict
has occurred to record a 'pre-image', and then again after the
conflict has been resolved to record the corresponding 'post-image'.
